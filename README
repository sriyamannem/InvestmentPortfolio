(1)  the general  problem  you  are  trying  to  solve  
helping people track their investments using this program

(2)  what  are  the  assumptions  and  limitations  of  your solution 
updating the the price of investment has to be done manually not automatically

first an investment must be bought and the user can sell it, update it's price, find his/her gain or loss buy get gain and find specific investments using search 

(4) how is the program tested for correctness (i.e., the test plan should be part of the README file) 

-command menu should take you to the correct interfaces

 -for buy button
 input for type: stock
 input for symbol: hi

 input for quantity: 97
 input for price: 8

 input for type: mutalfund
 input for symbol: kk
 input for name: hello
 input for quantity: 9
 input for price: 8

 then total gain is: -54.94

 -for search 

 if the following input was added to buy:

 input for price: 8

 input for type: stock
 input for symbol: ko
 input for name: hello u
 input for quantity: 97
 input for price: 8

 input for type: mutalfund
 input for symbol: kk
 input for name: hello
